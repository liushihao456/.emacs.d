;;; Commentary:

;; Use Tree-sitter as backend to indent source code.
;;
;; Provide an `indent-line-function` using the emacs-tree-sitter package
;; Usage (e.g., for TSX):
;;
;; (require 'tree-sitter-indent)
;; (setq-local tree-sitter-indent-current-scopes tsx-mode-indent-scopes)
;; (setq-local indent-line-function #'tree-sitter-indent-line)
;;
;; The indent scopes is an alist, whose keys include:
;; 1. indent-all, whose nodes will be indented one ``tree-sitter-indent-offset''
;;    forward relative to the indentation level of the parent node.
;; 2. indent-body, meaning any node whose parent node is one of these will be
;;    indented one ``tree-sitter-indent-offset'' forward relative to the
;;    indentation level of the parent node.
;; 3. indent-relative-to-parent, meaning any node whose parent node is one of
;;    these will be indented one ``tree-sitter-indent-offset'' forward relative
;;    to the column of the parent node's start-position.
;; 4. no-nesting, meaning any node whose parent node and parent's parent node
;;    are both one of these, will not be indented forward, even if its parent
;;    node is one of indent-body's nodes.
;;    This is used for situations such as nested ternary_expressions.
;; 5. aligned-siblings, whose nodes will be aligned to their siblings (nodes
;;    with the same parent and of the same type).
;; 6. outdent, whose nodes will be outdented one ``tree-sitter-indent-offset''
;;    backward relative to what they would otherwise.
;;
;; And the indent scopes alist's values are node types, e.g.,
;; (statement_block class_body).
